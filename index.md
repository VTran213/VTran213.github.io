### CPSC 120

* Lab 7, part 1

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because we got to utilize stoi for the first time in the lab. we were able to figured out how to change string to int using stoi that we learned in class. The lab also helped me to understand how use Stoi in a code.

* Lab 8, part 1

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because it helped me understand bool. The lab helped to learn what bool was meant to do and how to implement it into coding. This helped me a lot with the later labs as well.

* Lab 5, part 2 

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first time I really understood how to code and use int and double. It was really cool to learn how to do math with them. This lab was when I was starting to be able to do more and understand how to work with C++.
