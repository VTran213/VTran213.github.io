### CPSC 120

* Lab 7, part 1

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because we got to utilize stoi for the first time in the lab. we were able to figured out how to change string to int using stoi that we learned in class. The lab also helped me to understand how use Stoi in a code.

* Lab 8, part 1

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because it helped me understand bool. The lab helped to learn what bool was meant to do and how to implement it into coding. This helped me a lot with the later labs as well.

* Lab 5, part 2 

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first time I really understood how to code and use int and double. It was really cool to learn how to do math with them. This lab was when I was starting to be able to do more and understand how to work with C++.

### CPSC 121

* Lab 9, prob 2

    Lab 9, prob 2 was a favorite of mine because it allowed us to practice a lot of pointers. Especially on practicing the shared ptr process. This lab also focused on the concept of overload as well.

* Lab 12, prob 2

    Lab 12, prob 2 was a favorite because it allowed us to create a game based on the among us game. This lab had us create the characters from the game like the crewmates and impostors. The lab practiced with inheritance and function overriding.

* Lab Project, Leftover Food Tracker Project

    This project was very useful because it had us create a class design for ourselves and then implement it into our code. The project allowed us to practice the different concepts that we learned in CPSC 121 like std::vector, std::map, function designs, loops, and coditional statements. It also helped us practice how to break down a big code into small tasks.
